530    Exif.Image.YCbCrSubSampling    The sampling ratio of chrominance components in relation to the luminance component. In JPEG compressed data a JPEG marker is used instead of this tag.
531    Exif.Image.YCbCrPositioning    The position of chrominance components in relation to the luminance component. This field is designated only for JPEG compressed data or uncompressed YCbCr data. The TIFF default is 1 (centered); but when Y:Cb:Cr = 4:2:2 it is recommended in this standard that 2 (co-sited) be used to record data, in order to improve the image quality when viewed on TV systems. When this field does not exist, the reader shall assume the TIFF default. In the case of Y:Cb:Cr = 4:2:0, the TIFF default (centered) is recommended. If the reader does not have the capability of supporting both kinds of <YCbCrPositioning>, it shall follow the TIFF default regardless of the value in this field. It is preferable that readers be able to support both centered and co-sited positioning.
532    Exif.Image.ReferenceBlackWhite    The reference black point value and reference white point value. No defaults are given in TIFF, but the values below are given as defaults here. The color space is declared in a color space information tag, with the default being the value that gives the optimal image characteristics Interoperability these conditions.

It is the copyright notice of the person or organization claiming rights to the image. The Interoperability copyright statement including date and rights should be written in this field; e.g., "Copyright, John Smith, 19xx. All rights reserved.". In this standard the field records both the photographer and editor copyrights, with each recorded in a separate part of the statement. When there is a clear distinction between the photographer and editor copyrights, these are to be written in the order of photographer followed by editor copyright, separated by NULL (in this case since the statement also ends with a NULL, there are two NULL codes). When only the photographer copyright is given, it is terminated by one NULL code. When only the editor copyright is given, the photographer copyright part consists of one space followed by a terminating NULL code, then the editor copyright is given.

50706    Exif.Image.DNGVersion    This tag encodes the DNG four-tier version number. For files compliant with version 1.1.0.0 of the DNG specification, this tag should contain the bytes: 1, 1, 0, 0.
50707    Exif.Image.DNGBackwardVersion    This tag specifies the oldest version of the Digital Negative specification for which a file is compatible. Readers shouldnot attempt to read a file if this tag specifies a version number that is higher than the version number of the specification the reader was based on. In addition to checking the version tags, readers should, for all tags, check the types, counts, and values, to verify it is able to correctly read the file.
50708    Exif.Image.UniqueCameraModel    Defines a unique, non-localized name for the camera model that created the image in the raw file. This name should include the manufacturer's name to avoid conflicts, and should not be localized, even if the camera name itself is localized for different markets (see LocalizedCameraModel). This string may be used by reader software to index into per-model preferences and replacement profiles.
50709    Exif.Image.LocalizedCameraModel    Similar to the UniqueCameraModel field, except the name can be localized for different markets to match the localization of the camera name.
50710    Exif.Image.CFAPlaneColor    Provides a mapping between the values in the CFAPattern tag and the plane numbers in LinearRaw space. This is a required tag for non-RGB CFA images.
50711    Exif.Image.CFALayout    Describes the spatial layout of the CFA.
50712    Exif.Image.LinearizationTable    Describes a lookup table that maps stored values into linear values. This tag is typically used to increase compression ratios by storing the raw data in a non-linear, more visually uniform space with fewer total encoding levels. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
50713    Exif.Image.BlackLevelRepeatDim    Specifies repeat pattern size for the BlackLevel tag.
50714    Exif.Image.BlackLevel    Specifies the zero light (a.k.a. thermal black or black current) encoding level, as a repeating pattern. The origin of this pattern is the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle. The values are stored in row-column-sample scan order.
50715    Exif.Image.BlackLevelDeltaH    If the zero light encoding level is a function of the image column, BlackLevelDeltaH specifies the difference between the zero light encoding level for each column and the baseline zero light encoding level. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
50716    Exif.Image.BlackLevelDeltaV    If the zero light encoding level is a function of the image row, this tag specifies the difference between the zero light encoding level for each row and the baseline zero light encoding level. If SamplesPerPixel is not equal to one, this single table applies to all the samples for each pixel.
50717    Exif.Image.WhiteLevel    This tag specifies the fully saturated encoding level for the raw sample values. Saturation is caused either by the sensor itself becoming highly non-linear in response, or by the camera's analog to digital converter clipping.
50718    Exif.Image.DefaultScale    DefaultScale is required for cameras with non-square pixels. It specifies the default scale factors for each direction to convert the image to square pixels. Typically these factors are selected to approximately preserve total pixel count. For CFA images that use CFALayout equal to 2, 3, 4, or 5, such as the Fujifilm SuperCCD, these two values should usually differ by a factor of 2.0.
50719    Exif.Image.DefaultCropOrigin    Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropOrigin specifies the origin of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied), relative to the top-left corner of the ActiveArea rectangle.
50720    Exif.Image.DefaultCropSize    Raw images often store extra pixels around the edges of the final image. These extra pixels help prevent interpolation artifacts near the edges of the final image. DefaultCropSize specifies the size of the final image area, in raw image coordinates (i.e., before the DefaultScale has been applied).
50721    Exif.Image.ColorMatrix1    ColorMatrix1 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order. The ColorMatrix1 tag is required for all non-monochrome DNG files.
50722    Exif.Image.ColorMatrix2    ColorMatrix2 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order.
50723    Exif.Image.CameraCalibration1    CameraCalibration1 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the first calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix1 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
50724    Exif.Image.CameraCalibration2    CameraCalibration2 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the second calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix2 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
50725    Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix1    ReductionMatrix1 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the first calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
50726    Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix2    ReductionMatrix2 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the second calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order.
50727    Exif.Image.AnalogBalance    Normally the stored raw values are not white balanced, since any digital white balancing will reduce the dynamic range of the final image if the user decides to later adjust the white balance; however, if camera hardware is capable of white balancing the color channels before the signal is digitized, it can improve the dynamic range of the final image. AnalogBalance defines the gain, either analog (recommended) or digital (not recommended) that has been applied the stored raw values.
50728    Exif.Image.AsShotNeutral    Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as the coordinates of a perfectly neutral color in linear reference space values. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotWhiteXY tag.
50729    Exif.Image.AsShotWhiteXY    Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as x-y chromaticity coordinates. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotNeutral tag.
50730    Exif.Image.BaselineExposure    Camera models vary in the trade-off they make between highlight headroom and shadow noise. Some leave a significant amount of highlight headroom during a normal exposure. This allows significant negative exposure compensation to be applied during raw conversion, but also means normal exposures will contain more shadow noise. Other models leave less headroom during normal exposures. This allows for less negative exposure compensation, but results in lower shadow noise for normal exposures. Because of these differences, a raw converter needs to vary the zero point of its exposure compensation control from model to model. BaselineExposure specifies by how much (in EV units) to move the zero point. Positive values result in brighter default results, while negative values result in darker default results.
50731    Exif.Image.BaselineNoise    Specifies the relative noise level of the camera model at a baseline ISO value of 100, compared to a reference camera model. Since noise levels tend to vary approximately with the square root of the ISO value, a raw converter can use this value, combined with the current ISO, to estimate the relative noise level of the current image.
50732    Exif.Image.BaselineSharpness    Specifies the relative amount of sharpening required for this camera model, compared to a reference camera model. Camera models vary in the strengths of their anti-aliasing filters. Cameras with weak or no filters require less sharpening than cameras with strong anti-aliasing filters.
50733    Exif.Image.BayerGreenSplit    Only applies to CFA images using a Bayer pattern filter array. This tag specifies, in arbitrary units, how closely the values of the green pixels in the blue/green rows track the values of the green pixels in the red/green rows. A value of zero means the two kinds of green pixels track closely, while a non-zero value means they sometimes diverge. The useful range for this tag is from 0 (no divergence) to about 5000 (quite large divergence).
50734    Exif.Image.LinearResponseLimit    Some sensors have an unpredictable non-linearity in their response as they near the upper limit of their encoding range. This non-linearity results in color shifts in the highlight areas of the resulting image unless the raw converter compensates for this effect. LinearResponseLimit specifies the fraction of the encoding range above which the response may become significantly non-linear.
50735    Exif.Image.CameraSerialNumber    CameraSerialNumber contains the serial number of the camera or camera body that captured the image.
50736    Exif.Image.LensInfo    Contains information about the lens that captured the image. If the minimum f-stops are unknown, they should be encoded as 0/0.
50737    Exif.Image.ChromaBlurRadius    ChromaBlurRadius provides a hint to the DNG reader about how much chroma blur should be applied to the image. If this tag is omitted, the reader will use its default amount of chroma blurring. Normally this tag is only included for non-CFA images, since the amount of chroma blur required for mosaic images is highly dependent on the de-mosaic algorithm, in which case the DNG reader's default value is likely optimized for its particular de-mosaic algorithm.
50738    Exif.Image.AntiAliasStrength    Provides a hint to the DNG reader about how strong the camera's anti-alias filter is. A value of 0.0 means no anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera is prone to aliasing artifacts with some subjects), while a value of 1.0 means a strong anti-alias filter (i.e., the camera almost never has aliasing artifacts).
50739    Exif.Image.ShadowScale    This tag is used by Adobe Camera Raw to control the sensitivity of its 'Shadows' slider.
50740    Exif.Image.DNGPrivateData    Provides a way for camera manufacturers to store private data in the DNG file for use by their own raw converters, and to have that data preserved by programs that edit DNG files.
50741    Exif.Image.MakerNoteSafety    MakerNoteSafety lets the DNG reader know whether the EXIF MakerNote tag is safe to preserve along with the rest of the EXIF data. File browsers and other image management software processing an image with a preserved MakerNote should be aware that any thumbnail image embedded in the MakerNote may be stale, and may not reflect the current state of the full size image.
50778    Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant1    The illuminant used for the first set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix1, CameraCalibration1, ReductionMatrix1). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the LightSource EXIF tag. If set to 255 (Other), then the IFD must also include a IlluminantData1 tag to specify the x-y chromaticity or spectral power distribution function for this illuminant.
50779    Exif.Image.CalibrationIlluminant2    The illuminant used for an optional second set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix2, CameraCalibration2, ReductionMatrix2). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the CalibrationIlluminant1 tag; however, if both are included, neither is allowed to have a value of 0 (unknown). If set to 255 (Other), then the IFD must also include a IlluminantData2 tag to specify the x-y chromaticity or spectral power distribution function for this illuminant.
50780    Exif.Image.BestQualityScale    For some cameras, the best possible image quality is not achieved by preserving the total pixel count during conversion. For example, Fujifilm SuperCCD images have maximum detail when their total pixel count is doubled. This tag specifies the amount by which the values of the DefaultScale tag need to be multiplied to achieve the best quality image size.
50781    Exif.Image.RawDataUniqueID    This tag contains a 16-byte unique identifier for the raw image data in the DNG file. DNG readers can use this tag to recognize a particular raw image, even if the file's name or the metadata contained in the file has been changed. If a DNG writer creates such an identifier, it should do so using an algorithm that will ensure that it is very unlikely two different images will end up having the same identifier.
50827    Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileName    If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the file name of that original raw file.
50828    Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileData    If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the compressed contents of that original raw file. The contents of this tag always use the big-endian byte order. The tag contains a sequence of data blocks. Future versions of the DNG specification may define additional data blocks, so DNG readers should ignore extra bytes when parsing this tag. DNG readers should also detect the case where data blocks are missing from the end of the sequence, and should assume a default value for all the missing blocks. There are no padding or alignment bytes between data blocks.
50829    Exif.Image.ActiveArea    This rectangle defines the active (non-masked) pixels of the sensor. The order of the rectangle coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right.
50830    Exif.Image.MaskedAreas    This tag contains a list of non-overlapping rectangle coordinates of fully masked pixels, which can be optionally used by DNG readers to measure the black encoding level. The order of each rectangle's coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right. If the raw image data has already had its black encoding level subtracted, then this tag should not be used, since the masked pixels are no longer useful.
50831    Exif.Image.AsShotICCProfile    This tag contains an ICC profile that, in conjunction with the AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag, provides the camera manufacturer with a way to specify a default color rendering from camera color space coordinates (linear reference values) into the ICC profile connection space. The ICC profile connection space is an output referred colorimetric space, whereas the other color calibration tags in DNG specify a conversion into a scene referred colorimetric space. This means that the rendering in this profile should include any desired tone and gamut mapping needed to convert between scene referred values and output referred values.
50832    Exif.Image.AsShotPreProfileMatrix    This tag is used in conjunction with the AsShotICCProfile tag. It specifies a matrix that should be applied to the camera color space coordinates before processing the values through the ICC profile specified in the AsShotICCProfile tag. The matrix is stored in the row scan order. If ColorPlanes is greater than three, then this matrix can (but is not required to) reduce the dimensionality of the color data down to three components, in which case the AsShotICCProfile should have three rather than ColorPlanes input components.
50833    Exif.Image.CurrentICCProfile    This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentPreProfileMatrix tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.
50834    Exif.Image.CurrentPreProfileMatrix    This tag is used in conjunction with the CurrentICCProfile tag. The CurrentICCProfile and CurrentPreProfileMatrix tags have the same purpose and usage as the AsShotICCProfile and AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag pair, except they are for use by raw file editors rather than camera manufacturers.
50879    Exif.Image.ColorimetricReference    The DNG color model documents a transform between camera colors and CIE XYZ values. This tag describes the colorimetric reference for the CIE XYZ values. 0 = The XYZ values are scene-referred. 1 = The XYZ values are output-referred, using the ICC profile perceptual dynamic range. This tag allows output-referred data to be stored in DNG files and still processed correctly by DNG readers.
50931    Exif.Image.CameraCalibrationSignature    A UTF-8 encoded string associated with the CameraCalibration1 and CameraCalibration2 tags. The CameraCalibration1 and CameraCalibration2 tags should only be used in the DNG color transform if the string stored in the CameraCalibrationSignature tag exactly matches the string stored in the ProfileCalibrationSignature tag for the selected camera profile.
50932    Exif.Image.ProfileCalibrationSignature    A UTF-8 encoded string associated with the camera profile tags. The CameraCalibration1 and CameraCalibration2 tags should only be used in the DNG color transfer if the string stored in the CameraCalibrationSignature tag exactly matches the string stored in the ProfileCalibrationSignature tag for the selected camera profile.
50933    Exif.Image.ExtraCameraProfiles    A list of file offsets to extra Camera Profile IFDs. Note that the primary camera profile tags should be stored in IFD 0, and the ExtraCameraProfiles tag should only be used if there is more than one camera profile stored in the DNG file.
50934    Exif.Image.AsShotProfileName    A UTF-8 encoded string containing the name of the "as shot" camera profile, if any.
50935    Exif.Image.NoiseReductionApplied    This tag indicates how much noise reduction has been applied to the raw data on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. A 0.0 value indicates that no noise reduction has been applied. A 1.0 value indicates that the "ideal" amount of noise reduction has been applied, i.e. that the DNG reader should not apply additional noise reduction by default. A value of 0/0 indicates that this parameter is unknown.
50936    Exif.Image.ProfileName    A UTF-8 encoded string containing the name of the camera profile. This tag is optional if there is only a single camera profile stored in the file but is required for all camera profiles if there is more than one camera profile stored in the file.
50937    Exif.Image.ProfileHueSatMapDims    This tag specifies the number of input samples in each dimension of the hue/saturation/value mapping tables. The data for these tables are stored in ProfileHueSatMapData1, ProfileHueSatMapData2 and ProfileHueSatMapData3 tags. The most common case has ValueDivisions equal to 1, so only hue and saturation are used as inputs to the mapping table.
50938    Exif.Image.ProfileHueSatMapData1    This tag contains the data for the first hue/saturation/value mapping table. Each entry of the table contains three 32-bit IEEE floating-point values. The first entry is hue shift in degrees; the second entry is saturation scale factor; and the third entry is a value scale factor. The table entries are stored in the tag in nested loop order, with the value divisions in the outer loop, the hue divisions in the middle loop, and the saturation divisions in the inner loop. All zero input saturation entries are required to have a value scale factor of 1.0.
50939    Exif.Image.ProfileHueSatMapData2    This tag contains the data for the second hue/saturation/value mapping table. Each entry of the table contains three 32-bit IEEE floating-point values. The first entry is hue shift in degrees; the second entry is a saturation scale factor; and the third entry is a value scale factor. The table entries are stored in the tag in nested loop order, with the value divisions in the outer loop, the hue divisions in the middle loop, and the saturation divisions in the inner loop. All zero input saturation entries are required to have a value scale factor of 1.0.
50940    Exif.Image.ProfileToneCurve    This tag contains a default tone curve that can be applied while processing the image as a starting point for user adjustments. The curve is specified as a list of 32-bit IEEE floating-point value pairs in linear gamma. Each sample has an input value in the range of 0.0 to 1.0, and an output value in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. The first sample is required to be (0.0, 0.0), and the last sample is required to be (1.0, 1.0). Interpolated the curve using a cubic spline.
50941    Exif.Image.ProfileEmbedPolicy    This tag contains information about the usage rules for the associated camera profile.
50942    Exif.Image.ProfileCopyright    A UTF-8 encoded string containing the copyright information for the camera profile. This string always should be preserved along with the other camera profile tags.
50964    Exif.Image.ForwardMatrix1    This tag defines a matrix that maps white balanced camera colors to XYZ D50 colors.
50965    Exif.Image.ForwardMatrix2    This tag defines a matrix that maps white balanced camera colors to XYZ D50 colors.

50969    Exif.Image.PreviewSettingsDigest    A unique ID of the conversion settings (for example, MD5 digest) used to render the preview stored in the IFD.
50970    Exif.Image.PreviewColorSpace    This tag specifies the color space in which the rendered preview in this IFD is stored. The default value for this tag is sRGB for color previews and Gray Gamma 2.2 for monochrome previews.
50971    Exif.Image.PreviewDateTime    This tag is an ASCII string containing the name of the date/time at which the preview stored in the IFD was rendered. The date/time is encoded using ISO 8601 format.
50972    Exif.Image.RawImageDigest    This tag is an MD5 digest of the raw image data. All pixels in the image are processed in row-scan order. Each pixel is zero padded to 16 or 32 bits deep (16-bit for data less than or equal to 16 bits deep, 32-bit otherwise). The data for each pixel is processed in little-endian byte order.
50973    Exif.Image.OriginalRawFileDigest    This tag is an MD5 digest of the data stored in the OriginalRawFileData tag.
50974    Exif.Image.SubTileBlockSize    Normally, the pixels within a tile are stored in simple row-scan order. This tag specifies that the pixels within a tile should be grouped first into rectangular blocks of the specified size. These blocks are stored in row-scan order. Within each block, the pixels are stored in row-scan order. The use of a non-default value for this tag requires setting the DNGBackwardVersion tag to at least 1.2.0.0.
50975    Exif.Image.RowInterleaveFactor    This tag specifies that rows of the image are stored in interleaved order. The value of the tag specifies the number of interleaved fields. The use of a non-default value for this tag requires setting the DNGBackwardVersion tag to at least 1.2.0.0.
50981    Exif.Image.ProfileLookTableDims    This tag specifies the number of input samples in each dimension of a default "look" table. The data for this table is stored in the ProfileLookTableData tag.
50982    Exif.Image.ProfileLookTableData    This tag contains a default "look" table that can be applied while processing the image as a starting point for user adjustment. This table uses the same format as the tables stored in the ProfileHueSatMapData1 and ProfileHueSatMapData2 tags, and is applied in the same color space. However, it should be applied later in the processing pipe, after any exposure compensation and/or fill light stages, but before any tone curve stage. Each entry of the table contains three 32-bit IEEE floating-point values. The first entry is hue shift in degrees, the second entry is a saturation scale factor, and the third entry is a value scale factor. The table entries are stored in the tag in nested loop order, with the value divisions in the outer loop, the hue divisions in the middle loop, and the saturation divisions in the inner loop. All zero input saturation entries are required to have a value scale factor of 1.0.

51022    Exif.Image.OpcodeList3    Specifies the list of opcodes that should be applied to the raw image, just after it has been demosaiced.
51041    Exif.Image.NoiseProfile    NoiseProfile describes the amount of noise in a raw image. Specifically, this tag models the amount of signal-dependent photon (shot) noise and signal-independent sensor readout noise, two common sources of noise in raw images. The model assumes that the noise is white and spatially independent, ignoring fixed pattern effects and other sources of noise (e.g., pixel response non-uniformity, spatially-dependent thermal effects, etc.).
51043    Exif.Image.TimeCodes    The optional TimeCodes tag shall contain an ordered array of time codes. All time codes shall be 8 bytes long and in binary format. The tag may contain from 1 to 10 time codes. When the tag contains more than one time code, the first one shall be the default time code. This specification does not prescribe how to use multiple time codes. Each time code shall be as defined for the 8-byte time code structure in SMPTE 331M-2004, Section 8.3. See also SMPTE 12-1-2008 and SMPTE 309-1999.
51044    Exif.Image.FrameRate    The optional FrameRate tag shall specify the video frame rate in number of image frames per second, expressed as a signed rational number. The numerator shall be non-negative and the denominator shall be positive. This field value is identical to the sample rate field in SMPTE 377-1-2009.
51058    Exif.Image.TStop    The optional TStop tag shall specify the T-stop of the actual lens, expressed as an unsigned rational number. T-stop is also known as T-number or the photometric aperture of the lens. (F-number is the geometric aperture of the lens.) When the exact value is known, the T-stop shall be specified using a single number. Alternately, two numbers shall be used to indicate a T-stop range, in which case the first number shall be the minimum T-stop and the second number shall be the maximum T-stop.
51081    Exif.Image.ReelName    The optional ReelName tag shall specify a name for a sequence of images, where each image in the sequence has a unique image identifier (including but not limited to file name, frame number, date time, time code).

The default value for this tag is default final size of the current DNG file, which is DefaultCropSize * DefaultScale.
51090    Exif.Image.OriginalBestQualityFinalSize    If this file is a proxy for a larger original DNG file, this tag specifics the best quality final size of the larger original file from which this proxy was generated. The default value for this tag is the OriginalDefaultFinalSize, if specified. Otherwise the default value for this tag is the best quality size of the current DNG file, which is DefaultCropSize * DefaultScale * BestQualityScale.
51091    Exif.Image.OriginalDefaultCropSize    If this file is a proxy for a larger original DNG file, this tag specifics the DefaultCropSize of the larger original file from which this proxy was generated. The default value for this tag is OriginalDefaultFinalSize, if specified. Otherwise, the default value for this tag is the DefaultCropSize of the current DNG file.
51107    Exif.Image.ProfileHueSatMapEncoding    Provides a way for color profiles to specify how indexing into a 3D HueSatMap is performed during raw conversion. This tag is not applicable to 2.5D HueSatMap tables (i.e., where the Value dimension is 1).
51108    Exif.Image.ProfileLookTableEncoding    Provides a way for color profiles to specify how indexing into a 3D LookTable is performed during raw conversion. This tag is not applicable to a 2.5D LookTable (i.e., where the Value dimension is 1).
51109    Exif.Image.BaselineExposureOffset    Provides a way for color profiles to increase or decrease exposure during raw conversion. BaselineExposureOffset specifies the amount (in EV units) to add to the BaselineExposure tag during image rendering. For example, if the BaselineExposure value for a given camera model is +0.3, and the BaselineExposureOffset value for a given camera profile used to render an image for that camera model is -0.7, then the actual default exposure value used during rendering will be +0.3 - 0.7 = -0.4.
51110    Exif.Image.DefaultBlackRender    This optional tag in a color profile provides a hint to the raw converter regarding how to handle the black point (e.g., flare subtraction) during rendering. If set to Auto, the raw converter should perform black subtraction during rendering. If set to None, the raw converter should not perform any black subtraction during rendering.
51111    Exif.Image.NewRawImageDigest    This tag is a modified MD5 digest of the raw image data. It has been updated from the algorithm used to compute the RawImageDigest tag be more multi-processor friendly, and to support lossy compression algorithms.

51177    Exif.Image.DepthFormat    Specifies the encoding of any depth data in the file. Can be unknown (apart from nearer distances being closer to zero, and farther distances being closer to the maximum value), linear (values vary linearly from zero representing DepthNear to the maximum value representing DepthFar), or inverse (values are stored inverse linearly, with zero representing DepthNear and the maximum value representing DepthFar).
51178    Exif.Image.DepthNear    Specifies distance from the camera represented by the zero value in the depth map. 0/0 means unknown.
51179    Exif.Image.DepthFar    Specifies distance from the camera represented by the maximum value in the depth map. 0/0 means unknown. 1/0 means infinity, which is valid for unknown and inverse depth formats.
51180    Exif.Image.DepthUnits    Specifies the measurement units for the DepthNear and DepthFar tags.
51181    Exif.Image.DepthMeasureType    Specifies the measurement geometry for the depth map. Can be unknown, measured along the optical axis, or measured along the optical ray passing through each pixel.

The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the LightSource EXIF tag; CalibrationIlluminant1 and CalibrationIlluminant2 must also be present. If set to 255 (Other), then the IFD must also include a IlluminantData3 tag to specify the x-y chromaticity or spectral power distribution function for this illuminant.
52530    Exif.Image.CameraCalibration3    CameraCalibration3 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the third calibration illuminant. The matrix is stored in row scan order. This matrix is stored separately from the matrix specified by the ColorMatrix3 tag to allow raw converters to swap in replacement color matrices based on UniqueCameraModel tag, while still taking advantage of any per-individual camera calibration performed by the camera manufacturer.
52531    Exif.Image.ColorMatrix3    ColorMatrix3 defines a transformation matrix that converts XYZ values to reference camera native color space values, under the third calibration illuminant. The matrix values are stored in row scan order.

52533    Exif.Image.IlluminantData1    When the CalibrationIlluminant1 tag is set to 255 (Other), then the IlluminantData1 tag is required and specifies the data for the first illuminant. Otherwise, this tag is ignored. The illuminant data may be specified as either a x-y chromaticity coordinate or as a spectral power distribution function.
52534    Exif.Image.IlluminantData2    When the CalibrationIlluminant2 tag is set to 255 (Other), then the IlluminantData2 tag is required and specifies the data for the second illuminant. Otherwise, this tag is ignored. The format of the data is the same as IlluminantData1.
52535    Exif.Image.IlluminantData3    When the CalibrationIlluminant3 tag is set to 255 (Other), then the IlluminantData3 tag is required and specifies the data for the third illuminant. Otherwise, this tag is ignored. The format of the data is the same as IlluminantData1.
52537    Exif.Image.ProfileHueSatMapData3    This tag contains the data for the third hue/saturation/value mapping table. Each entry of the table contains three 32-bit IEEE floating-point values. The first entry is hue shift in degrees; the second entry is saturation scale factor; and the third entry is a value scale factor. The table entries are stored in the tag in nested loop order, with the value divisions in the outer loop, the hue divisions in the middle loop, and the saturation divisions in the inner loop. All zero input saturation entries are required to have a value scale factor of 1.0.
52538    Exif.Image.ReductionMatrix3    ReductionMatrix3 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the third calibration illuminant.
